        What is Join?
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="lightblue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project
        management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
        part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
        method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
        efficiency (or flow). <span class="lightblue">Join</span> leverages
        the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
        in an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that
        <span class="lightblue">Join</span> is designed as an educational
        exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
        strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
        guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other
        aspects of quality regarding <span class="lightblue">Join</span>.

        How to use it
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
        <span class="lightblue">Join</span>:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li class="secondHeadlineHelpPrivacyPolicyLegalNotice">
          Exploring the Board
        </li>
        <p>
          When you log in to <span class="lightblue">Join</span>, you'll find
          a default board. This board represents your project and contains
          four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
          "Done".
        </p>
        <li class="secondHeadlineHelpPrivacyPolicyLegalNotice">
          Creating Contacts
        </li>
        <p>
          In <span class="lightblue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
          collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
          "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added,
          these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the
          tasks on the board.
        </p>
        <li class="secondHeadlineHelpPrivacyPolicyLegalNotice">
          Adding Cards
        </li>

        <p>
          Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
          Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
          appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
          the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
        </p>

        <li class="secondHeadlineHelpPrivacyPolicyLegalNotice">
          Moving Cards
        </li>

        <p>
          As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
          the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
          another.
        </p>

        <li class="secondHeadlineHelpPrivacyPolicyLegalNotice">
          Deleting Cards
        </li>

        <p>
          Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list
          or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the
          board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action
          is irreversible. Remember that using
          <span class="lightblue">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
          updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the
          current state of your project. Have more questions about
          <span class="lightblue">Join</span>? Feel free to contact us at
          [Your Contact Email]. We're here to help you!

      <p>Enjoy using Join!</p>
