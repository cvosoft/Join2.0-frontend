  <p>
    We are pleased about your interest in our project management tool. Protecting your privacy is very important to us.
    Below, we inform you in detail about how we handle your data.

  <h2 class="secondHeadlineHelpPrivacyPolicyLegalNotice">
    1. Access data and hosting
  </h2>
  <p>
    You can visit our websites without providing any personal information. Each time a website is accessed, the web
    server automatically saves a so-called server log file, which contains, for example, the name of the requested file,
    your IP address, date and time of the access, the amount of data transferred, and the requesting provider (access
    data) and documents the access. This access data is evaluated exclusively for the purpose of ensuring trouble-free
    operation of the site as well as improving our offering. This serves to protect our legitimate interests in a
    correct presentation of our offering, which are overriding in the context of a balancing of interests, in accordance
    with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

    2. Data processing for contract processing and contact
  </h2>

  <h3>2.1 Data processing for contract processing</h3>

  <p>
    For the purpose of contract processing (including inquiries about and processing of any warranty and performance
    disruption claims as well as any statutory updating obligations) in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b
    GDPR, we collect personal data if you voluntarily provide it to us in the context of your order. Mandatory fields
    are marked as such because we absolutely need the data in these cases for contract processing, and we cannot send
    the order without this information. What data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. Further
    information on the processing of your data, in particular on the transfer to our service providers for the purposes
    of order, payment, and shipping processing, can be found in the following sections of this privacy policy. After
    complete processing of the contract, your data will be restricted for further processing and deleted after the
    expiry of the tax and commercial retention periods in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. c GDPR, unless you
    have expressly consented to further use of your data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR or we
    reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is legally permitted and about which we inform you in this
    declaration.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Customer account</h3>

  <p>
    If you have given your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR by deciding to open a customer
    account, we will use your data for the purpose of opening the customer account as well as storing your data for
    further future orders on our website. Deletion of your customer account is possible at any time and can either be
    done by sending a message to the contact option described in this privacy policy or through a designated function in
    the customer account. After deletion of your customer account, your data will be deleted unless you have expressly
    consented to further use of your data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR or we reserve the right
    to use data beyond this, which is legally permitted and about which we inform you in this declaration.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3 Contact</h3>

  <p>
    In the context of customer communication, we collect personal data for the purpose of processing your inquiries in
    accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, if you voluntarily provide us with this data when contacting us
    (e.g. via contact form or email). Mandatory fields are marked as such because we absolutely need the data in these
    cases to process your contact. What data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. After complete
    processing of your inquiry, your data will be deleted unless you have expressly consented to further use of your
    data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is
    legally permitted and about which we inform you in this declaration.

    3. Data processing for payment processing
  </h2>
  <p>
    In the context of payment processing for our project management tool, we work with the following partners: technical
    service providers, credit institutions, payment service providers. No personal data is stored by third parties.
  </p>

  <h3>3.1 Data processing for transaction processing</h3>

  <p>
    Depending on the selected payment method, we pass on the data necessary for the processing of the payment
    transaction to our technical service providers, who act as processors for us, or to the commissioned credit
    institutions or to the selected payment service provider, to the extent that this is necessary for the processing of
    the payment. This serves the fulfillment of the contract in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. The
    payment service providers partly collect the data necessary for the processing of the payment themselves, e.g. on
    their own website or through a technical integration in the order process. In this respect, the privacy policy of
    the respective payment service provider applies. If you have any questions about our partners for payment processing
    and the basis of our cooperation with them, please contact the contact option described in this privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h3>
    3.2 Data processing for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimization of our payment processes
  </h3>

  <p>
    If necessary, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data necessary
    for the processing of the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and the optimization of our
    payment processes (e.g. invoicing, processing of contested payments, support for accounting). This serves our
    legitimate interests in protecting against fraud or in efficient payment management, which are overriding in the
    context of a balancing of interests, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.
